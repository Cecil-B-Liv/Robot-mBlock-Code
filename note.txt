Design and program the mBot2 Neo robot to navigate a connected maze of multiple paths

During demo, the maze will contain:
• Interconnected paths with both white.
• Stop and go signs will be placed at various intersections or straightaways.
• Random obstacles will be placed along the path during demo


Success Criteria of your final implementation
To complete the project successfully, your robot must:

Follow urban traffic logic when different traffic signs are combined
Stay consistently on the WHITE path.
STOP Navigation on RED color
RESUME Navigation on GREEN color
SLOW DOWN on YELLOW color then SPEED UP after 5 seconds
YELLOW to GREEN: Maitain current speed, speed up on the 2nd GREEN.
On RED color, do a U-turn if there is no change for 10 seconds
Avoid all non-sign obstacles without manual intervention.
IF obstacle is not 100% on the track, the robot needs to drift accordingly to resume navigation.
For a 'T' intersection with an obstacle and a RED color, the robot needs to take the available path that is not obstructed.
